## YearWorthIt

**A minimalist linear regression model built to explore how the year a house was built influences its sale price.**
This project leverages the Ames Housing dataset to investigate temporal pricing trends in real estate using StatsModels.

### Project Objective

To answer a focused question:
> **Does the year a house was built have a measurable impact on its sale price?**

By applying simple linear regression to 'YearBuilt' and 'SalePrice', this project aims to:

* Understand the direction and strength of the relationship.
* Visualize patterns in housing market evolution.
* Build a foundational model for real estate prediction.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

* Scatter plots
* Linear regression model using StatsModels
* Interpretation of regression line and coefficients

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* StatsModels
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Key Insight

A positive linear relationship exists: newer homes generally fetch higher prices, though the slope is modest. Great for beginners exploring modeling with one numeric predictor.

## Try It Out

Clone the repo and run the notebook to:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ames-yearbuilt-model.git
cd ames-yearbuilt-model
```
